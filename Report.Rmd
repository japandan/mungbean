## Mungbean Sprout Growth

Mungbeans were sprouted in 3 petri dishes at varying temperatures.  The germination%, length, and weight were measured at 24 hour intervals for 5 days.  With this data, we can determine if the temperature had an effect on the growth.  We would also like to determine the ideal temperature of those tested.  The source of the data was @article.

### Temperature & Light Conditions

The 3 temperatures that are being compared are 25&deg;C, 30&deg;C, and Ambient (ranging from 21&deg;C - 31&deg;C).  Seeds were grown at constant temperature by placing them in a controlled incubator.  Seeds were grown in darkness for this set of data.

### Growing Medium

The seeds were grown in petri dishes, placed on a wet tissue used to keep them moist.  There were 10 seeds per sample.  Seeds were soaking in water for 12 hours prior to placing them in the dishes which was determined to be to optimal time.

## Growth Plot

This graph seems to show that the Ambient temperature produced the longest sprouts.  However, the study concluded that the change in length from 24 hours to 120 hours was greatest at 30&deg;C.  Since all were started from seeds, if maximum length was the desired outcome and 0 was your starting length, ambient growing conditions seem fine.

I would like to prove that the study was correct by showing the difference in length from 24 hours -> 120 hours and calculating the %percentage increase at each temp.

```{r growthplot, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data=mungbeans_df, aes(x=duration, y=length, group=temp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=temp, linetype=temp))+
  geom_point(aes(color=temp)) +
  labs(title="Plot of Length by Time",x="Time (hours)", y = "Sprout Length (cm)")
```

## Weight Plot

This plot shows that the 25&deg;C is the optimal temperature to achieve maximum weight. The starting weight was not equal.  It may be necessary to scale these weights so see the a more accurate % increase at the 3 temps. The final weight for the samples grown at 25&deg;C was the greatest but the initial starting weight was the lowest for that sample.  This means the actual weight increase was more than shown on this plot, given equal weight samples.

```{r weightplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=mungbeans_df, aes(x=duration, y=sproutwt, group=temp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=temp, linetype=temp))+
  geom_point(aes(color=temp)) +
  labs(title="Plot of Fresh Weight by Time",x="Time (hours)", y = "Sprout Weight (g)")


## DATA Manipulation required for Analysis
## make a new df that has the temp as columns

length_df<-mungbeans_df %>% 
  select(temp, duration, length) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=temp, values_from=length)

## normalize the columns for the 3 temps
scaled_df <- length_df %>% mutate_at(c("Ambient", "25", "30"), ~(scale(.) %>% as.vector))

kable(length_df, caption="Lengths Compared at 3 Temps")
```

At this point, I would like to perform a linear regression test to confirm that 25&deg;C is the best temperature for growing these sprouts.  I think the first step would be to normalize.  I might be able to skip this step if it is not needed to perform the test.

```{r normalize, echo=FALSE}
kable(scaled_df, caption="Normalized Data")

#ggplot(data=mungbeans_df, aes(x=duration, y=sproutdrywt, group=temp)) +
#  geom_line(aes(color=temp, linetype=temp))+
#  geom_point(aes(color=temp)) +
#  labs(title="Plot of Dry Weight by Time",x="Time (hours)", y = "Sprout Weight (g)")
```
